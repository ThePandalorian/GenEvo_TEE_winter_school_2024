# GenEvo/TransEvo winter school (2024)

Instructors: Hanna Kokko, Thomas Keaney, Hanna ten Brink and Victor Ronget

The purpose of this course is to introduce mathematical modelling to researchers that primarily conduct empirical research in the fields of ecology, evolution and molecular biology. The course should also be valuable to young theoreticians looking to expand their modelling toolkit. 

This github repository is the place you should look for all online resources associated with the school. Materials associated with each workshop can be downloaded from here, by 'cloning' the repository, or downloading it in ZIP form. To do this, look for the green `code` icon on the top right of this page. Click and copy the web URL to clone, or simply download the ZIP. 

## Required software 

The school is divided into four workshops, each led by a different instructor. These will involve coding in real time, using the `R-studio` IDE to run `R`. To participate in these workshops, you'll therefore need to:

1. Have installed a recent version of R: download it [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
2. Have R-studio installed: download it [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

`R` is open source, which, among other things, means it's completely free to download. If you have any trouble with this, let Tom know on the Sunday evening and he'll give you a hand. 

## How we'll code 

Just by downloading the files in this repository, you'll be ready to start coding in a transparent, reproducible way, which is fast becoming an essential skill in our fields. We'll work using an `R.project`, which removes any need to muck around with working directories or paths, which is nice because your code becomes user-agnostic. We'll encourage you to write code in `quarto` documents, which are a modern version of R-markdown docs, and can be used simultaneously as an `R.script` and text editor. That means you'll leave each workshop with a polished report that includes all your notes, documents your code, and displays the figures it produces. 

If you're already familiar with workflows like this, that's great! But if this sounds completely foreign, don't worry! That's why we're here.
